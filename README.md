Description: 
  The Online Notice Board System is a web-based platform designed to simplify and digitize the traditional notice board process in schools, colleges, and organizations. This system allows authorized users (such as admins or staff) to post important announcements, notices, or circulars, which can be accessed by students or employees in real-time from any device with internet access.

It eliminates the need for physical boards and manual updates, ensuring that all users receive timely and consistent information. The platform includes role-based access control, where admins can manage notices and users can view and acknowledge them.

Key features include user authentication, notice categorization (academic, general, events, emergency), notice scheduling, and search/filter functionalities. The system also ensures that users are notified about new notices via email or dashboard alerts.

This project was developed using modern web technologies to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.
